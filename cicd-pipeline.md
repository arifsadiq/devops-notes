##  Some Popular deployment strategies used in CI/CD pipelines

🔮 𝐑𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: Incrementally replaces instances of the previous version of an application with the new version without downtime.

🔮 𝐁𝐥𝐮𝐞-𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: Involves two identical environments, one hosting the current version (blue) and the other hosting the new version (green). Traffic is switched from blue to green once the new version is ready.

🔮 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: Releases the new version to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire user base. This strategy allows for testing in production with real users and workloads.

🔮 𝐀/𝐁 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: Similar to canary deployments but specifically targets testing new features or changes among different user segments to compare performance.

🔮 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐓𝐨𝐠𝐠𝐥𝐞𝐬 (𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐠𝐬): Allows teams to enable or disable features in the application without deploying new code. This facilitates testing and gradual rollout of new features.
